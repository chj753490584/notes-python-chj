## Simple Notes 
+ when `[2:10]`, it means with 2 and without 10
+ numpy and pandas
+ `lambda x,y:x*y` is a function which defines a new function easily
+ append/extend: `l3.append(l1)` means the same with `l3=l3+l1` ; `l3.extend(l1)` means inserting whole l1 into l3 as one element(l1)
+ k+=1
+ `print k` and `print str(k)` and `print 'string'`
